Welcome to the **mp-api** code documentation!
==================================

For more comprehensive documentation on how to use the code to access Materials Project data, `see the main updated documentation <https://next-gen-docs.materialsproject.org/downloading-data/how-do-i-download-the-materials-project-database>`_.
