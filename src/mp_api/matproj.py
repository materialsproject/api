                https://www.materialsproject.org/dashboard. If this is None,
                the code will check if there is a "PMG_MAPI_KEY" setting.

                version changes, you will be notified. The current database version is

        Performs an advanced query using MongoDB-like syntax for directly
        querying the Materials Project database. This allows one to perform
        queries which are otherwise too cumbersome to perform using the standard
        convenience methods.

        Please consult the Materials API documentation at
        https://github.com/materialsproject/mapidoc, which provides a
        comprehensive explanation of the document schema used in the Materials
        Project (supported criteria and properties) and guidance on how best to
        query for the relevant information you need.

        For queries that request data on more than CHUNK_SIZE materials at once,
        this method will chunk a query by first retrieving a list of material
        IDs that satisfy CRITERIA, and then merging the criteria with a
        restriction to one chunk of materials at a time of size CHUNK_SIZE. You
        can opt out of this behavior by setting CHUNK_SIZE=0. To guard against
        intermittent server errors in the case of many chunks per query,
        possibly-transient server errors will result in re-trying a give chunk
        up to MAX_TRIES_PER_CHUNK times.

        Args:
            criteria (str/dict): Criteria of the query as a string or
                mongo-style dict.

                If string, it supports a powerful but simple string criteria.
                E.g., "Fe2O3" means search for materials with reduced_formula
                Fe2O3. Wild cards are also supported. E.g., "\\*2O" means get
                all materials whose formula can be formed as \\*2O, e.g.,
                Li2O, K2O, etc.

                Other syntax examples:
                mp-1234: Interpreted as a Materials ID.
                Fe2O3 or *2O3: Interpreted as reduced formulas.
                Li-Fe-O or *-Fe-O: Interpreted as chemical systems.

                You can mix and match with spaces, which are interpreted as
                "OR". E.g. "mp-1234 FeO" means query for all compounds with
                reduced formula FeO or with materials_id mp-1234.

                Using a full dict syntax, even more powerful queries can be
                constructed. For example, {"elements":{"$in":["Li",
                "Na", "K"], "$all": ["O"]}, "nelements":2} selects all Li, Na
                and K oxides. {"band_gap": {"$gt": 1}} selects all materials
                with band gaps greater than 1 eV.
            properties (list): Properties to request for as a list. For
                example, ["formula", "formation_energy_per_atom"] returns
                the formula and formation energy per atom.
            chunk_size (int): Number of materials for which to fetch data at a
                time. More data-intensive properties may require smaller chunk
                sizes. Use chunk_size=0 to force no chunking -- this is useful
                when fetching only properties such as 'material_id'.
            max_tries_per_chunk (int): How many times to re-try fetching a given
                chunk when the server gives a 5xx error (e.g. a timeout error).
            mp_decode (bool): Whether to do a decoding to a Pymatgen object
                where possible. In some cases, it might be useful to just get
                the raw python dict, i.e., set to False.

        Returns:
            List of results. E.g.,
            [{u'formula': {u'O': 1, u'Li': 2.0}},

        Gets critical reactions between two reactants.

        Get critical reactions ("kinks" in the mixing ratio where
        reaction products change) between two reactants. See the
        `pymatgen.analysis.interface_reactions` module for more info.

        Args:
            reactant1 (str): Chemical formula for reactant
            reactant2 (str): Chemical formula for reactant
            open_el (str): Element in reservoir available to system
            relative_mu (float): Relative chemical potential of element in
                reservoir with respect to pure substance. Must be non-positive.
            use_hull_energy (bool): Whether to use the convex hull energy for a
            given composition for the reaction energy calculation. If false,
            the energy of the ground state structure will be preferred; if a
            ground state can not be found for a composition, the convex hull
            energy will be used with a warning message.

                reactant mixing ratio, `energy` is the reaction energy
                in eV/atom, and `rxn` is a

        Parses a powerful and simple string criteria and generates a proper

        Args:
            criteria_string (str): A string representing a search criteria.
                Also supports wild cards. E.g.,
                something like "*2O" gets converted to
                {'pretty_formula': {'$in': [u'B2O', u'Xe2O', u"Li2O", ...]}}

                Other syntax examples:
                    mp-1234: Interpreted as a Materials ID.
                    Fe2O3 or *2O3: Interpreted as reduced formulas.
                    Li-Fe-O or *-Fe-O: Interpreted as chemical systems.

                You can mix and match with spaces, which are interpreted as
                "OR". E.g., "mp-1234 FeO" means query for all compounds with
                reduced formula FeO or with materials_id mp-1234.

            A mongo query dict.
